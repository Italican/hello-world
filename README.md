# hello-world
My first GitHub project.
I'm a police detective who enjoys learning new things.  I have had an interest for years in learning Portuguese and occasionally Spanish and other languages.  When I was younger I had dabbled in website html but never really got into coding.  Now at the age of 35 and 12 years into my career I'm eager to find something else to do after this job is over.  I've been most drawn to fraud investigations and internet scams.  The more I learn about thsoe investigations the more I realize I am interested in coding and how computers work and speak with one another.  I find it fascinating though a bit overwhelming.

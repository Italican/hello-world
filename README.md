# hello-world
My first GitHub project.
At the age of 35 and 12 years into my career I'm eager to find something else to do after this job is over.  I've been most drawn to fraud investigations and internet scams.  The more I learn about those investigations the more I realize I am interested in coding and how computers work and speak with one another.  I find it fascinating though a bit overwhelming.
